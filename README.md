# MaliciousURLDetection

Our project uses machine learning techniques to detect malicious URLs with the aim of providing a safe experience to the user.

The method of detecting malicious URLs based on a set of markers or rules can quickly and accurately detect malicious URLs. 

Machine learning algorithms are a part of the whole malicious URL detection system.
There are three types of machine learning algorithms that can be applied on malicious URL detection methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
and semi supervised learning. 
And the detection methods are based on URL behaviors.
